- Data visualization is an important skill that is used in many parts of the data analysis process. Exploratory data visualization generally occurs during and after the data wrangling process, and is the main method that we will use to understand the patterns and relationships present in our data. This understanding will help us approach any statistical analyses and will help us to build conclusions and findings. This process might also illuminate additional data cleaning tasks to be performed.

- Explanatory data visualization techniques are used after generating your findings, and are used to help communicate your results to others. Understanding design considerations will make sure that your message is clear and effective. In addition to being a good producer of visualizations, going through this project will also help you be a good consumer of visualizations that are presented to you by others.

## Summary of Findings

- I found that in all data, Male gender is about 75% of users and about 90% of users are subscribers.
- 8 AM and 5 PM are the most preffered two hours to start the trip as it is the time going and backing from scholl,college and work
- The most common trip starts from Berry St at 4th St to San Francisco Ferry building(Harry Bridges Plaza)
- The number of trips increases in tuesday and thursday and reach its minimum at weekend (sat and sun)
- Trip duration for other gender is higher than male and female.
- As the age of the user increases, trip duration of him decreases which make sense.
- Trip duration for customer is higher than the subscriber in general during the week.
